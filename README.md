### Goal: Create a Wu-Tang Clan name generator. Present the user with 5 survey questions and based on those answers randomly generate their name. The name doesn't have to be exact names, but Wu-Tang sounding-ish names. Ex: Childish Gambino (who actually got his name from a Wu-Tang name generator).

### Optimiazation: I would have liked to use more adjectives and had more options.

### Lesson learned: Javascript doesn't always have to be complicated.
